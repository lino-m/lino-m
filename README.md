## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lino. Fresh out of a coding boot camp and now a Teaching Assistant for Le Wagon, I started 2020 by changing career paths and learn how to code.
You can also find and connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lino-maurer/"><img height="18" src="https://github.com/lino-m/lino-m/blob/master/images/linkedin-logo.png?raw=true"></a> to learn more about my professional background.

#### ðŸ“«: Otherwise, you can always reach me right me here: lino@q-b.de
